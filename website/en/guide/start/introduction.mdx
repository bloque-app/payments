# Introduction

Welcome to Bloque Payments documentation. Bloque provides a comprehensive payment infrastructure that enables developers to accept payments through multiple methods including cards, PSE (Colombian online banking), and cash payments.

## What is Bloque Payments?

Bloque Payments is a TypeScript-first payment processing platform that simplifies payment integration into your web and mobile applications. It provides both backend SDKs for secure payment processing and frontend components for seamless user experiences.

## Key Features

### 💳 Multiple Payment Methods

Accept payments through various channels:
- **Card Payments**: Credit and debit cards
- **PSE**: Colombian online banking system
- **Cash Payments**: Generate receipts for physical payment locations

### ⚛️ React Integration

Pre-built React components for quick integration:

```tsx
import { BloqueCheckout } from '@bloque/payments-react';

<BloqueCheckout
  config={config}
  appearance={appearance}
  onSuccess={(response) => {
    console.log('Payment successful!', response.id);
  }}
  onError={(error) => {
    console.error('Payment failed:', error.message);
  }}
/>
```

### 🔒 Secure by Default

PCI-compliant infrastructure with:
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure API key management
- Webhook signature verification
- No sensitive data stored on your servers

### 🎨 Customizable UI

Customize the payment experience to match your brand:

```typescript
const appearance = {
  primaryColor: '#10b981',
  borderRadius: '12px',
  fontFamily: 'Inter, system-ui, sans-serif',
};
```

### 📱 Type-Safe

Built with TypeScript from the ground up:
- Full type definitions included
- Discriminated union types for payment methods
- IntelliSense support in modern editors
- Compile-time type checking

## Architecture

Bloque Payments follows a secure architecture pattern where sensitive payment data never touches your backend:

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│ React Component │─────▶│  Your Backend   │─────▶│  Bloque API  │
│  (Frontend)     │      │   (SDK Usage)   │      │              │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

1. **Frontend** captures payment data securely
2. **Your Backend** processes payments using Bloque SDK
3. **Bloque API** handles payment processing and verification

## Use Cases

### E-commerce Platforms

Build online stores with seamless checkout experiences and support for multiple payment methods.

### SaaS Applications

Accept subscription payments and one-time purchases directly in your application.

### Marketplace Platforms

### Mobile Applications
